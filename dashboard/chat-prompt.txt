I have a site that uses a bootstrap template. I am redesigning it. I have a figma file of what it needs to be updated to. I have screenshots of the pages and can take some of the design system if needed and if finished. I also had the figma to bootstrap 5 plugin generate code from the pages. I will give them to you when we begin. I have a templates folder that holds my scss files that overwrite bootstraps styles. I need you to take my screenshots and generated code and give me the complete code as well as tell me which file it should go in. I have templates/components/<each component scss file as neede> and templates/_variables, and templates/style.scss. Is there anything else you need from me before we get started?
