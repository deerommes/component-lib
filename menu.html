          Soulful Spirits stands as a cherished, family-run gem in the heart of
          our community. Established in 1995 by the dynamic duo, Lisa and Mark
          Thompson, the reins have since been passed to their dedicated
          offspring, Matt Thompson. Our mission is simple: to serve up
          delectable dishes and enticing drinks that leave our guests craving
          more.
          <br />Nestled in a cozy corner, Soulful Spirits Bar & Grill offers a
          welcoming haven where the weary find solace over a chilled pint and
          heartwarming meals. It's an ideal spot for both solo relaxation and
          family gatherings. We pride ourselves on maintaining a smoke-free
          environment, attracting a friendly and respectful crowd. <br />For
          those nights when you're more inclined to lounge in your loungewear,
          we've got you covered. With our delivery service extending up to a
          10-mile radius, your favorite comfort meals are just a phone call away
          from arriving at your doorstep.
